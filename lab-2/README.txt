Instructions:
 - Run the program by typing "java TicTacToe" in the command line.
 - When the game starts, the program will ask you to enter a playing mode. Mode 1 allows 2 users to play against each other, 
   and Mode 2 allows the user to play against the computer. Any other choice will terminate the program.

Mode 1:
 - The program will ask player 1 for his/her name, and assign the character 'X'
 - The program will ask player 2 for his/her name, and assign the character 'O'
 - The program will show a grid as to what are the valid moves that can be made by a player, and give the general instructions.
   The game starts with player 1 making the first move. Alternate moves will be made from now on.
 - At any given turn, the program will display the current grid and ask the active player for a move. If the choice made is 
   invalid (ie not in the range 1-9 or choosing an occupied cell), the player will be prompted to make another choice.
 - The game is over when one player wins, and a congratulatory message is displayed. If the game ends in a draw, a message saying
   so will be displayed.

Mode 2:
 - The program will ask the player for his/her name, and assign the character 'X'
 - The computer will be assigned the character 'O'
 - The program will show a grid as to what are the valid moves that can be made by a player, and give the general instructions.
   The game starts with player 1 making the first move. Alternate moves will be made from now on.

   invalid (ie not in the range 1-9 or choosing an occupied cell), the player will be prompted to make another choice. 
 - The computer will make automatic choices. The computer's choice along with the current grid will be displayed each time.
